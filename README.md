# PhysPi

Code for PhysPi Laboratory Environmental Monitoring System, constructed as my fourth year honours project in physics at Carleton University (Ottawa ON) under the supervision of Dr. Thomas Koffas and the CU-ITk research team.

This is the repo for the project as it stood in April 2018 when I completed my time on the research team. The project is still in use and has been modified by other students and researchers.

## Background

The CU-ITk research team is a branch of CERN's ATLAS project responsible for the design and development of silicon microstrip sensors for the reconstruction of the ATLAS detector's innermost part, the Inner Tracker (ITk).  These sensors are composed of extremely sensitive and fragile material and are being worked on in an undergraduate engineering laboratory alongside multiple other engineering and physics research projects.  Due to the fragility of the sensors and the nature of the research circumstances, it is essential to the project that the temperature and humidity conditions be monitored for changes and the subsequent testing and development can be calibrated accordingly.  For my undergraduate thesis in physics I constructed the PhysPi Environmental Monitoring System to do this job.

## Hardware

This system employs the use of the following hardware in a very simple setup:

* Raspberry Pi 3
* Arduino Uno board
* 2X SHT75 digital temperature and humidity sensors
* The following necessary accessories:
  * Raspberry Pi case
  * Raspberry Pi power source
  * HDMI monitor and adapter
